# people's platform project

DRAFT V0.1 - 18-11-2023 / 17:43

Revive the Internet with the People's Platform Project! Our mission: to reclaim the social media landscape from advertiser domination. This project enables individuals to freely promote and support their favorite content and creators. It's a space where you can monetize your creative work without the restrictions of advertiser censorship. 



Problem Statement
Social media today is dominated by advertisers, resulting in content that's tailored to their interests rather than the community's. This limits free speech and leads to a flood of simple, low-quality content. Large companies prioritize ad revenue over open and diverse content.
Content creators have to obey censorship and big tech rules to earn a living, and the users/community has to live with numbed down content.

Solution
Our project aims to revolutionize the social media landscape by giving the power back to the community. We provide a solution that enables users to independently upvote and downvote content on various social media platforms using blockchain technology. 
Users up/downvotes contribute to show community interest and trends, they are not monetary transactions, but require gas.
Other users can be "contributors (donators)" that can contribute to a "supporter pool", from this pool, creators are paid out, a smart contract calculates a fair share over-time, based on up/downvote ratios (community interest).
This allows content creators to manage their content openly and sustainably. We introduce a website that supersedes the original social media sorting algorithm, reflecting the decentralized voting system's impact on content quality.

Key Components
Chrome Extension: Our planned extension integrates seamlessly with Metamask, adding extra upvote and downvote buttons to social media pages.

Smart Contract: The planned smart contract includes a "supporter pool" for collecting and managing donations. Users can upvote or downvote content on social media, with the extension calling a function in the smart contract. The contract tracks the number of votes for each wallet.
A "dau pool" may be introduced for any administrative work such as taking over transaction costs for creator payouts and at some point,possibly rewarding the users with tokens / crypto rewards.

Website: To override the original social media content sorting, we're developing a website that displays content based on the number of upvotes, giving more upvoted content higher visibility.


Api: Provides sorted and paginated content from different chains to the WebApp

Automatic Payout: One challenge is implementing the automatic payout system. Options include using an automated trigger, or triggering the action after a set time passed whenever an up or downvote is issues, transaction costs MUST not be taken from the user in that case.

Open Topics
Automatic Payout Mechanism: We're exploring options for efficient and fair payout mechanisms, aiming to avoid censorship by large companies.
An API for the extension was suggested and should be discussed.
