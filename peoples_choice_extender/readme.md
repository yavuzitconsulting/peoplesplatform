README for Peoples Choice Extender Extension (Development Version)

Overview
Peoples Choice Extender is currently in the development phase. This project is an innovative browser extension aimed at supporting content creators through a novel approach involving blockchain technology. It is being developed with the vision of evolving into a non-profit platform dedicated to helping content creators collect funds.

Purpose
The primary functionality of Peoples Choice Extender is to enhance user interaction on YouTube by injecting custom upvote and downvote buttons beneath YouTube videos. The key feature of this extension is that it records these user interactions on the blockchain, providing a transparent and tamper-proof record of viewer feedback. It's important to note that while the extension integrates blockchain technology, it does not involve any monetary transactions beyond the gas fees required for blockchain operations.

Current State and Future Plans
Development Status: The extension is still in the early stages of development. As such, some features might be in a prototype state or pending further refinement.
Online Presentation: We are working on creating a more concise and informative online presence to better showcase the project's capabilities and vision. This will be updated as the development progresses.
Features and Functionality
Content Interaction: Custom buttons are dynamically added under YouTube videos for upvoting and downvoting.
Blockchain Integration: Interactions are consolidated on the blockchain, offering a permanent and transparent record of user engagement.
Non-monetary Focus: The extension's scope is limited to interaction recording on the blockchain, without any direct financial transactions.


We appreciate your time and effort in reviewing our project and welcome any feedback that can help us improve and move closer to our vision of supporting content creators.

The name of the extension may be subject to change!
